This theme is compatible with version 20251129.1 (2.5.13).

This is only an edited version of the default My Little Forum  [style.min.css](https://github.com/My-Little-Forum/mylittleforum/blob/master/themes/default/style.min.css) and not a full theme. Only changes made are the color scheme to match the FFXI.EMAIL site.

There are two methods for installation. First, you can simply copy the default folder into the themes directory, rename it to your preference, and then place the file from [style.min.css](https://github.com/Etrix-c/FFXI.EMAIL-BBS-Theme/blob/main/style.min.css). Alternatively, you may visit [release page](https://github.com/Etrix-c/FFXI.EMAIL-BBS-Theme/releases/tag/1) and extract dark.zip into the themes directory, then navigate to the advanced settings to switch the theme to dark and save the changes.
